CODEX NEXT STEP LIST – TO EVALUATE
- Continue refining the prompt-construction logic so the assistant can better detect task type (translation, rewrite, cultural context) and anchor its tone based on rated responses.
- Persist and surface richer history insights (e.g., summarize highly rated answers, show recent disliked topics) to reinforce personalization in both UI and prompts.
- Add automated tests (unit tests for AppStateStore, prompt builder, and rating logic) to guard against regressions as features evolve.
- Build more robust error handling and user feedback, such as retry options and clearer status indicators when the OpenAI API fails.
- Enhance OpenAIClient resiliency: configurable timeouts, basic retry/backoff, clearer error diagnostics.
- Improve secret management for production builds (xcconfig or Keychain) so release builds don’t silently fail when env vars are missing.
- Add conversation management (naming/switching) and history trimming/token usage tracking.
- Stream assistant responses and offer import/export of personalization data to sync across devices.
